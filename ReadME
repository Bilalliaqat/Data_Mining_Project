run those files/notebooks in order:

1)in the utils.py you can find all the necessary function that we used in other files and notebooks
2)By running Generator.py we generate the dataset as well as the queries and the users set
3)the utility_matrix_generator generates both the random and the pseudo-random utility matrix
4)in the part A notebook you can find the main query recommendation algorithm as well as the experiments and the figures made
5)in the part B notebook we propose a method to compute the utility of a new query for all users. It also evaluate it by computing the rmse between every rated query and its predicted value
